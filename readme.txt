Archive of lua scripts for the 2Take1 menu. 
Non of these are made by me.

Every Script with it's own directory also has it's own readme with an installation guide + their original github (if they have one)

Put every other Script into your scripts folder, at "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\PopstarDevs\2Take1Menu\scripts"


Note, if you are searching for an older version of a script thats not in this branch, go to the old-scripts branch.
Also, I only update every 6-8 days or when there are alot of scripts that have updated.
