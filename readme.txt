Won't update anymore

Archive of lua scripts for the 2Take1 menu. 
Non of these are made by me.

Every Script with it's own directory also has it's own readme with an installation guide + their original github (if they have one)

Put every other Script into your scripts folder, at "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\PopstarDevs\2Take1Menu\scripts"


Note, if you are searching for an older version of a script thats not in this branch, go to the old-scripts branch.
