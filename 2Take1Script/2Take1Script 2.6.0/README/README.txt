In order to use the player bar v2 properly you will have to use the "Chalet Comprime" spritefont which is included in this script.
1. Take the file 'ChaletComprime.spritefont' and move it to '%appdata%\PopstarDevs\2Take1Menu\ui\fonts' (Not that you will have to reinject 2Take1 for it to appear in the menu).
2. Select the font in the menu ui as 'Script 5' (located at Local -> Settings -> Menu UI -> Fonts) and save it.
Now you are ready to go!
