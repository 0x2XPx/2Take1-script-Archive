# 2Take1-Moist-Script (Build 2.0.0.1)

### GTAV Script for 2Take1s Lua Engine (by -IN2-Moist-)

## Installation

**Required Files & Folders**:

These must be inside the Folder :

**-** scripts

- `MoistScript2.01.lua` (Main Script)

Inside the Scripts Folder you need another Folder called : 

**-** MoistsLUA_cfg

`
- Moist_Kicks.data
- Moist_Kicks2.data
`




Optional Extras :
`
- autoexec.lua

 (Script loader this will  Auto load multiple LUA files on start)

- settings.lua

 (**This is a Dependent file for Script loader to function)

`
also in Folder: ** MoistsLUA_cfg**
`
- MoistsScript_settings.ini

(This is Default LUA Save to include Main Script when starting)
`

For Better Compatibility with **2take1script**:

```- 1. Remove autoexec.lua & settings.lua
- 2. execute Moist2.10.lua first then 2take1script```

Seems to work so far without errors


The files and folders required are as they should be and should be extracted from the archive as above.

## Session Kicks

- NetBail ScriptHost Fuckarino

`Network bail Kick, with a Script host targeted kick which will kick all in session and will force the script host to send kicks
this has a really bad effect on yourself game ui goes flickery due to you being a script host and you getting spammed with those
kicks although 2take1 protects you from being kicked it makes the game harder to play with the ui going crazy so last resort kick!`

- Kick Host until Session host

`Fast kick all hosts until you are host`

- Network Bail Kick

`Network kick using globals to force the player to bail from the session very effective against most Modder`s but most good menus 
would be protected against this! if it is going to work and kick them it would instantly remove them with no delay`

- Host Kick All

`Only works while you are the current session host, but will kick all players with a Players have voted you out of session message
preventing them joining again. Does not effect you or friends just all others`
